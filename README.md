As we can't remember everything, users tend to forget to buy the things they want to buy. 
However, with the assistance of this app, you can make a list of the groceries you intend to buy so 
that you don't forget anything in your list. This app is designed keeping in view the users needs and
busy lives as a result of which we skip important things of our daily schedule, one of the most significant part is Grocery Shopping.
This app is easy to use and users can feed the items to buy without any hassle.
